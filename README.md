# Senescence-associated morphological profiles (SAMPs)
An image-based phenotypic profiling method for evaluating the inter and intra-model heterogeneity of senescence

This project aimed to utilise high-content analysis (HCA) for the characterisation of senescent cells from multiple models. I demonstrated that sophisticated multiparameter morphological analysis can be used to distinguish senescent cells and explore the heterogeneity of individual models.

# Project Details 
The project contains all the data that was used to construct the paper figures. Individual models are split up for the generation of standard score profiles, TSNEs and UMAPs. Files are intended to be run sequentially within each subfolder. 

0. Z-Socre Heatmaps: _Z-Score Heatmap from all models_
1. OIS: _Standard Score and Dim Reduction for OIS IMR90 model_
2. CM: _Standard Score and Dim Reduction for OIS conditioned media IMR90 model_
3. HMF: _Standard Score and Dim Reduction for replicative senescence in HMF model_
4. HDF_RS: _Standard Score and Dim Reduction for replicative senescence in HDF model_
5. Summary Heatmap: _Combined standard score profile for all models_
6. EFA: _Exploratory Factor Analysis for all models_
7. In_Vivo: _Palbociclib induced Sk-mel-103 xenograft assessment_
